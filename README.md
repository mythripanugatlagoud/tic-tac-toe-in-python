# Tic Tac Toe (Terminal Version)

A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where two players (X and O) take turns choosing their moves until someone wins or the game ends.

## Description

This Python program allows two users to play the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game in the terminal. The board is displayed after every move, and the program checks for a winner after each turn.

## Features

* Command-line interface
* Two-player support (X and O)
* Board updates after every move
* Win checking after every move
* Easy-to-understand code structure

## Game Logic

* The game board is represented as two lists: `xState` and `zState` for player X and O respectively.
* A position from 0 to 8 is chosen by the player to mark their move.
* The game checks for 8 possible winning combinations after every move.
* If a player wins, the game announces the winner and exits.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository or copy the code into a `.py` file (e.g., `tic_tac_toe.py`)
3. Run the script:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
